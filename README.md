# Helloust 👋

I'm currently studying to become CS-engineer. I'm generally eager to learn new frameworks and always interested of a challenging task. <br>
I'd like to describe myself as more backend oriented as I prefer to make things work like a clockwork, but I also like to dabble on making nice webdesigns.

## Skills

- Linux (Linux user 🐧)
- Docker & Kubernetes & Ansible
- Azure, AWS & Google Cloud services
- Programming Languages:
    - Golang (My beloved <3)
    - Typescript & Javascript:
        - Angular
        - React & little React Native
        - D3
    - Python
    - .NET & C# (ASP.NET Core)
    - Rust (currently interested)
- SQL and NoSQL databases
- Shellscripting (nothing too fancy)

## About me

On my freetime I like to read manga, cook and play video games... oh yeah, and also code. <br>
I like to say I'm not very talkative, but when I find really interesting topic to talk about, then I *REALLY* like to talk about it, maybe a bit too much.
